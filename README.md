TSW-chat-autologin
==================

In your The Secret World install, add a folder called:

    Scripts

In that folder, place the **auto_login** file.  Make sure you're logged all the way out of the game, then start it up.

As the script stands, you still need to have the AIE chat channel feed into the default General tab.  However, every time you login, it automatically has you join the AIE chat channel.
